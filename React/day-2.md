What is Content Delivery Network(CDN)? and What are its use cases?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a group of servers placed in different locations around the world that work together to deliver website content faster to users.

Think of it like this:

Imagine Netflix has only one server in the USA.
If someone from India watches a movie, the data has to travel a very long distance, so loading becomes slower.

Now imagine Netflix stores copies of that content on servers in many countries, including India.
When you open Netflix in India, the content is delivered from the nearest server instead of the USA.
That nearby server is part of a CDN.

What does a CDN store?

CDNs mainly store:

Images
Videos
CSS files
JavaScript files
Fonts
Website pages
App downloads

These are called static assets.

Main Uses of CDN
1. Faster Website Loading

The biggest use.

A CDN sends data from the closest server to the user, reducing distance and loading time.

Example:

Without CDN → Server in USA serves Indian user
With CDN → Indian CDN server serves Indian user

Result:

Faster websites
Faster video streaming
Better user experience
2. Reduces Load on Main Server

Instead of millions of users hitting one server, the traffic gets distributed across many CDN servers.

This prevents:

Server overload
Crashes during heavy traffic
3. Better Performance During High Traffic

Websites like:

Amazon
YouTube
Facebook

use CDNs because millions of users access them simultaneously.

4. Protection Against DDoS Attacks

A CDN can absorb huge amounts of fake traffic and protect the original server.

This improves security.

5. Improves Availability


So websites remain online even during failures.
If one CDN server fails, another nearby server can still deliver content.

Cross Origin:
 The crossorigin attribute in the script tag enables CrossOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS) for loading external JavaScript
files from different origin than the hosting web page. This
allows the script to access resources from the server hosting
the script, such as making HTTP requests or accessing data.


Q ) What is {} denotes in react?

classes, etc should come under {}. Whenever
I'm passing inside {}, will go as tag attributes of h1.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

When you use React through a CDN, you usually get two versions:

react.development.js
react.production.js (or react.production.min.js)

Both contain React, but they are made for different purposes.

1. react.development.js

This version is used while developing your app.

Example:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
Features
✅ Human-readable code

The file is not compressed, so developers can debug easily.

✅ Gives warnings and error messages

React helps developers by showing detailed warnings.

Example:

Missing key in list
Invalid props
Wrong hooks usage
✅ Easier debugging

Stack traces and error messages are clear.

❌ Bigger file size

Because it contains debugging tools and warnings.

❌ Slower than production version

Extra checks make it slightly slower.

2. react.production.js

This version is used in real/live websites.

Example:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>

Notice:

min.js means minimized/compressed.
Features
✅ Optimized for speed

All unnecessary development checks are removed.

✅ Smaller file size

The code is compressed/minified.

✅ Faster performance

Better for real users.

❌ No detailed warnings

React removes most developer helper messages.

❌ Harder to debug

The code is compressed into very small unreadable lines.

I'm passing inside {}, will go as tag attributes of h1.
📢 NOTE: React will overwrite everything inside "root"
